    fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying
    to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with services or goods). In this case, we may have to
    cancel a service or product you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How is your personal data collected?</h2>
  <p>We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:</p>

    data in the following circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
    <li>

      and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
    </li>

  </ul>
  <p>

  <h3>Marketing</h3>

  <p>
    Our lawful ground of processing your personal data to send you marketing communications is either your
    consent or our legitimate interests (namely to grow our business).
  </p>
  <p>
    Under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, we may send you marketing
    communications from us if (i) you made a purchase or asked for information from us about our goods or
    services or (ii) you agreed to receive marketing communications and in each case you have not opted out
    of receiving such communications since. Under these regulations, if you are a limited company, we may
    send you marketing emails without your consent. However you can still opt out of receiving marketing
    emails from us at any time.
  </p>
  <h3>Opting out</h3>
  <p>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us.</p>
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>Our website does not use cookies.</p>
  <h3>Change of purpose</h3>
  <p>
    We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably
    consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
    If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the
    original purpose, please contact us.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the
    legal basis which allows us to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance
    with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
  <p>
    We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table
    ‘Purposes for which we will use your personal data’ above.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Service providers, acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services,
      including Software providers for accounting, marketing and practice management solutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Professional advisers, acting as processors or joint controllers, including healthcare
      professionals, lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal,
      insurance and accounting services.
    </li>
    <li>To other professionals for the purposes of discussing your treatment</li>
    <li>
      HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities, acting as processors or joint
      controllers, based who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
      Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our
      assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change
      happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as
      set out in this privacy policy.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
    the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes
    and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our
    instructions.
  </p>
  <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
  <p>We may transfer your data outside the United Kingdom and European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
  <p>
    Many of our external third parties are based outside the United Kingdom and the EEA so their processing
    of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the United Kingdom and the EEA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the United Kingdom and the EEA, we ensure a similar
    degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
      adequate level of protection for personal data by the United Kingdom
    </li>
    <li>
      Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK
      Information Commissioner’s Office and the European Commission which give personal data the
      same protection it has in Europe.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring
    your personal data out of the United Kingdom and the EEA.
  </p>
  <h2>7. Data security</h2>
  <p>
    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
    lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
    personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to
    know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
    confidentiality.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and
    any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
  </p>
  <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
  <h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
  <p>
    We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we
    collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting
    requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we
    reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
    personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
    purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    By law we have to keep medical information about patients for 7 years after treatment has finished. For
    any children we treat we are obliged to retain the medical information until 7 years after the child’s 18 th
    birthday. By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity,
    Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see your legal rights below for further
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with
    you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
    further notice to you.
  </p>
  <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
  <p>
    Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
    You have the right to:

    <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). 
    This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete
    or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data
    you provide to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data
    where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
    remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
    below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
    personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
    request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your
    request.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a
    third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
    processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
    the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
    cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which
    override your rights and freedoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
    processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you want us to establish the data&#39;s accuracy.</li>
    <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
    <li>
      Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
      exercise or defend legal claims.
    </li>
    <li>
      You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
      legitimate grounds to use it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party
    you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
    this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
    we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
    this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
    withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise
    you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
  </p>
  <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
  <h3>No fee usually required</h3>
  <p>
    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
    Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
  </p>
  <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
  <p>
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
    to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
    that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
    ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
  </p>
  <h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
  <p>
    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a
    month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
    notify you and keep you updated.
