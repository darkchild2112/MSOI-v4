          <h4>Supervision</h4>
          <p>When professionals are working with young people, families, or adults with any mental health problems,  it is essential that they have formal supervision processes in place to support them to be effective and safe practitioners. At Making Sense Of It, we both have extensive experience of providing supervision both to other clinical psychologists and other health/social care professionals. When choosing a supervisor it is important to find the person with both the right skills and someone who you feel able to develop a safe and trusting relationship with.  If you are interested in discussing your supervision needs please get in touch with us and we would be happy to discuss this further.</p>
          <h4 style="padding-top: 10px;">Training</h4>

This could include training into educational settings, training for other health professionals or training for parents.
